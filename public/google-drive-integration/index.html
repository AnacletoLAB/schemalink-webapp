<h1>Google Drive Integration</h1>

<h2>What arrows.app does with user data</h2>
<p>
    Arrows.app involves one kind of user data: diagrams created with the app.
    These diagrams can optionally be stored as files in Google Drive.
    This is the only circumstance in which user data is transmitted to a server.
    Apart from this, user data never leaves the user's web browser and it is never accessible to
    Neo4j (the operator of arrows.app) or to third parties.
</p>

<p>
    Arrows.app only asks for permission to open files created by arrows.app, or those explicitly opened with arrows.app.
    This means that arrows.app is unable to access any of the other files in Google Drive.
</p>

<p>
    You can see the access granted to arrows.app by visiting the
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">permissions page</a> for your Google account.
    If you remove access for arrows.app, it will no longer be able to access your Google Drive.
</p>

<h2>How Google Drive integration enhances arrows.app</h2>

<p>
    Google Drive is a convenient and familiar place to store diagrams.
    Each diagram is stored as an individual file in Google Drive,
    complete with a thumbnail image to make it easier to find.
</p>

<p>
    Arrows.app includes a "Share" button that opens the familiar Google Drive sharing dialog.
    This dialog allows sharing the diagram with other Google Drive users.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, arrows.app adds itself to the Google Drive user interface.
    This makes it possible to open a diagram with arrows.app, or to create a new diagram,
    directly from the Google Drive user interface.
